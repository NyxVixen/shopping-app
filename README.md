Shopping App

App made using Firebase through the frontend path on Scrimba. You should be able to input an item into the text field. When clicking on "Add To Cart", the item should populate in the area below. When you click on an item in the "Shopping List", it should be removed from the app. All buttons have hovers effects, with a short transition time for a smoother transition.
